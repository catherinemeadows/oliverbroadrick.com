      About
    </h2>

    <p class="mainContent">
      I was born in Maine. I played hockey. I enjoyed learning math. I went to a private school for middle and high school, and I moved to Massachusetts with my family. I replaced hockey with rowing. I then went to college in Washington, DC. I now study computer science as well as philosophy and religion while rowing on the GW men's rowing team. I like learning a lot.
