                I am a final-year undergraduate student studying computer science 
                and math at 
                <a href="https://www.seas.gwu.edu/">George Washington University</a>. 
                I'm also a proud member of

            <h5>Election Security - Risk-Limiting Audits</h5>
            <p>
                In 2020, I began working on statistical risk-limiting audits (RLAs)
                which validate election results within rigorous error bounds.
                I am part of a team led by 
                <a href="https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~poorvi/">Professor Poorvi Vora</a>, and I 
                work on the theoretical parts of the problem and also
                develop software in our
                <a href="https://github.com/gwexploratoryaudits/r2b2">open source audit library</a>.
                The theory consists of beautiful mathematical ideas to
                accurately measure risk such that smaller sample sizes are sufficient to meet 
                stopping conditions.
                The implementation requires interesting algorithmic design
                to make computationally complex tasks feasible.
                Our 
                <a href="papers/simulations-of-ballot-polling-rlas.pdf">
                paper presenting simulation results
                </a> 
                for the comparison of 
                existing ballot-polling RLAs will appear in 
                <a href="https://fc22.ifca.ai/workshops.html">Voting '22</a>, 
                and additional manuscripts presenting novel audits and 
                related results are currently being drafted. 
            </p>
            <h5>Scheduling Algorithm - Neural Network Tasks</h5>
            <p>
                Given numerous real-time neural network tasks, meeting 
                deadlines
                necessitates a balancing of priority and precision to achieve
                optimal results. 
                I am working with 
                <a href="https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~narahari/">Professor Bhagi Narahari</a> to develop a
                scheduling algorithm that models such tasks as imprecise
                computations.
                We are designing the scheduling algorithm subject to new
                user-in-the-loop real-time constraints, and we are 
                implementing the algorithm to experimentally support
                theoretical guarantees. 
            </p>
            <h5>Computer Vision - Traffickcam</h5>
            <p>
                Human trafficking cases often have images from hotel rooms
                as evidence.
                A group led by <a href="https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~pless/">Professor Robert Pless</a>
                has already compiled a database of millions of hotel room images
                and developed the tool Traffickcam that can be used to 
                match query images hotel chains and locations.
                The National Center for Missing
                and Exploited Children (NCMEC) uses Traffickcam as it is, but 
                there is room for improvement. The current matching approach essentially
                reduces the resolution of the query image for use as input to a neural network.
                This ignores higher resolution details in the image that
                could be identifying features for a particular room.
                I am working on a new search capability that 
                computes descriptors of such key points in the image 
                and searches for similar points in the database to find matches.
